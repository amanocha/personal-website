# About
I am a first-year graduate student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) advised by [Professor Margaret Martonosi](http://www.princeton.edu/~mrm/). My broad area of research is Computer Architecture and as a contributor to the [DECADES](http://decades.cs.princeton.edu/) project, I work on the design of specialized hardware that can be reconfigured for various software applications, while optimizing performance and energy efficiency. I am also interested in protocols for consistency and coherence among heterogenous systems.   

Previously, I worked with [Professor Benjamin C. Lee](http://people.duke.edu/~bcl15/) at [Duke University](https://ece.duke.edu/), where I received my bachelor's degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as Computer Science. My research involved distributed systems, crowd computing and mobile architectures, and efficient hardware accelerator design space exploration with high-level synthesis.

I enjoy programming and have served as a software engineering intern at Lenovo, Cisco, and Adobe. I am also a 2017 [Duke Technology Scholar](https://dtech.duke.edu/).
