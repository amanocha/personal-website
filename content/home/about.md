# About
I am a first-year graduate student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) advised by [Professor Margaret Martonosi](http://www.princeton.edu/~mrm/). My broad area of research is Computer Architecture and as a contributor to the [DECADES](http://decades.cs.princeton.edu/) project, I am working on the design of specialized hardware that can be reconfigured for various software applications and optimizes performance and energy efficiency. I am also interested in protocols for consistency and coherence among heterogenous systems.   

Previously, I worked with [Professor Benjamin C. Lee](http://people.duke.edu/~bcl15/) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Duke University](https://ece.duke.edu/), where I received my Bachelor of Science degree. My research involved distributed systems, crowd computing and mobile architectures, and efficient hardware accelerator design space exploration with high-level synthesis.

I enjoy programming and have served as a software engineering intern at Lenovo, Cisco, and Adobe. I am also a 2017 [Duke Technology Scholar](https://dtech.duke.edu/).
